// Things you SHOULD change to make the server "yours" (remove the // and change the value):

//sv_public 1	// 0 or -1 (see description) if the server should not be on the public servers list
//hostname "Xonotic $g_xonoticversion Server"	// this name will appear on the server list (the $g_xonoticversion gets replaced with the current version)

// This is a good place for contact info (IRC, forum nick, etc.) so players can reach you when something is wrong with your server.
// Add line breaks using \n - e.g. "Line 1\nLine 2". Keep it as short as possible.
//sv_motd ""

// This sets the remote console password on the server, you also need to set the cvar to the same value on your client to use the 'rcon' command.
// Empty means rcon is disabled.

// Everything below has some sensible defaults so you don't really need to change anything.
// It's meant as inspiration for people who want to customize the server more.
// Some cvars have example or default values shown, some have an additional description/comment.
// For the rest, the description is available in console (type variable name and press TAB or use apropos/search).

//maxplayers // note: this is not the same as g_maxplayers

//net_address 0.0.0.0	// ONLY change this if you have problems with your server. Specifies the network interface used by the engine.  Set it to one of your internal IPs

//port 26000	// the port used by the server
// You are RECOMMENDED to change this value to a free port number on your server
// above 1024. The reason is that some bad ISPs might filter "gaming" ports, and
// changing the port your server runs on may make your server available to these
// people. Changing the port breaks nothing, the default simply matches Quake as
// we use a Quake-derived protocol and didn't do our own IANA port assignment yet
// (if anyone wants to go through that process, we'd be glad).

//log_file "server.log"	// server console output will also be copied to this file. This: "${serverconfig}.log" uses variable substitution to make the logfile have the same name as your config file with .log appended which is useful if you run several servers
//timestamps

//g_maplist_mostrecent_count 3	// number of maps that have to be played before a map can be repeated

// LIMITS: how long a match will last before the next map starts (-1 means use the map default, 0 = unlimited, please note that the variables fraglimit/timelimit can NOT be globally used for this but only DURING the match being played)

// Settings you MIGHT want to change for PRIVACY reasons.

//sv_status_privacy 1	// 1 hides IP addresses from "status" replies shown to clients, 0 shows them. Enables players to identify wellknown punks on your server OR is a threat to anonymity.. depending on your point of view :)

// This line sends the following data to our servers:
// - Date and time
// - Your server IP address
// - Your server ID hash, which is a fingerprint of the public key of your
//   server and does not impact security of your private key (use "crypto_keys"
//   on the console to show it)
// - Your server name ("hostname")
// - Current game type
// - Current map
// - Balance settings you have modified from defaults (only those that make
//   your server "impure")
// - For each weapon pairing (A, B), separately for player-player, player-bot,
//   bot-player, bot-bot pairings:
//   - Number of hits of players/bots holding A against players/bots holding B
//   - Number of frags of players/bots holding A against players/bots holding B
//   - Total damage of players/bots holding A against players/bots holding B
//
// We use this data to:
// - Optimize the game balance for future releases
// - Identify problems in the bot AI and improving it
// - Find settings that make servers "impure" that should not, so we can
//   whitelist them in future releases
//
// We will or might publish:
// - Global weapon pairing statistics for players vs players, or bots vs bots,
//   or any vs any, on a selection of servers
// - Per-gametype and per-map weapon pairing statistics players vs players, or
//   bots vs bots, or any vs any, on a selection of servers
// - Lists of commonly changed cvars, together with counts on how often they
//   are modified
//
// No information about the players on the server is sent, so as a server admin
// you need no permission of your players for this.
//
// No information about your server will be published - all published data sets
// will include data from multiple servers.
